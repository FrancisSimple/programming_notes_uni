ABSTRACT DATA TYPE (ADT), LISTS

Abstract data type is a set of data objects with a specification of a set of operations that can be performed 
over those data objects.
it does not contain details of how the set of operations is implemented.

================A LIST ADT==============
LinearList ADT: this is an abstract class, meaning it just shows the implementations, but not the how.
Array is an implementation of the List interface (it is not a list itself)
Array is thus a concrete class of the List interface.

*Note: the array itself is not a list. we can use it to make lists.
ArrayList is a List built and implemented using an array.

position in the list is different from the index in the list.

offset index: the number of index that we need to leave before inserting the first element in the list.
list size and array size are not the same.
list size refers to the number of actual elements in the list
array size refers to the total available length of space available to store elements.
