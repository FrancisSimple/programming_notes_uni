collection: a group of objects

Collections framework: a collection of interfaces and classes used to store 
and organise groups of elements or objects.
It is also the root interface for all the other classes and interfaces.

dequeue is a method that is pronounced "De-queue"

deque is a concrete class pronouced as "Deck"

interfaces in the new java editions contain methods with default implementations.

Collections class: this is not part of the framework.
It is useful to make operations on data structures with its static methods.
it does not need implemention of its own version.
it is a class.
It is a side class from which we reference some methods to use on our structures.

note the detail difference among: collection (group of objects),Collection(interface),Collections(side class not in framework)

Abstract calsses: some common methods are implemented, the rest can be done by user.

set is not ordered and denies duplicates.
list: ordered and allows duplicates.

interfaces used by the collections framework which are not part of it:
comparator, iterator, listIterator, Spliterator, RandomAcess. (to know well)

ArrayList has 3 constructors by default.

can we use a for-each loop on a non-generic class?
