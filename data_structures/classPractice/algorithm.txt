an algorithm is a precise sequence of finite steps or instructions for solving a 
problem or performing a computation.

common algorithms used:
 to reduce size of data: Opus (for audio) amd VP8/VP9, H.264 (for Video)
 google map: Dijkstra's (Route Finding) and the A* search algorithms.
 NASA: control external space- Control Systems and Scheduling algorithms
 for shortest path in internet for data transfer: Networking Routing (Dikjstra's, Bellman-Ford)
 used by search engines: Page Rank Algorithm, Space Partition Tree and Graph (SPTAG)
